#I.R.A.
Interacting Remote Avatar

This project deals with the idea of creating a robot consisting of interchangeable parts which 
represents some person with the help of remote access.

The I.R.A. is primarily a robot body being the basis of a remote control robot. This project 
should be seen as the starting point for someone wanting to create robot parts in order to 
increase the abilities of I.R.A.. Furthermore, it shall be possible to create and connect 
different robot parts to the I.R.A. in other projects. Due to the defined ports of the I.R.A. 
every kind of robot project is possible by adding arms with different features, other movement 
devices or interaction extensions.

The core of the I.R.A. is a Raspberry Pi computer which connects all robot extensions via CAM 
bus so they are able to interact with your crafted builds and ideas. Besides, the first version of 
the I.R.A. contains a pc power supply providing 12, 5 and 3.3 volts for your extension. 
Moreover, the I.R.A. will have a front-end that shall be developed in Unity so that the 
different project parts and especially your own I.R.A. extensions may be controlled. 

It is not important how you build your extensions as long as you add the required CAM bus 
connection as well as the mechanical connection to link it to the I.R.A.. It is also necessary 
to develop a Unity asset in order to control your own I.R.A. extension.

By means of I.R.A. and at least the movement extension, you shall be enabled to interact in 
a remote environment and it is thought to give you the opportunity of representing yourself 
wherever you would like to be represented.
